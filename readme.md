AppStack - Generate Transformer stacks and Interfaces at compile time

For the moment, please have a look at the source in
[Data/AppStack.hs](Data/AppStack.hs) and
[Data/AppStack/TH.hs](Data/AppStack/TH.hs). There are some comments and it's not
much code, I promise. You can also generate haddock documentation with `cabal
haddock`.

In [Data/AppStack/Example.hs](Data/AppStack/Example.hs) you'll find a pointless
but runnable example of how to build a program.
